# CrunchyPlayer
This video player was made with React.JS with the HTML5 video player to support better security while imitating CrunchyRoll's flash player.


Example Usage:
```
import CrunchyPlayer from './crunchyplayer.js';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="app">
        <CrunchyPlayer width="500" source="RAW_VIDEO_URL"/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
